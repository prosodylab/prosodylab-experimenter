## Welcome!

This is a just test experiment, **and not a real study!**

It is meant to illustrate the prosodylab-js-experimenter. 

If you are here because you want to participate in an actual study, you're in the wrong place!

The following experiment is a study in which you have to one rhyme. 

You can see the spreadsheet (a tab-delimited text file) used to generate the experiment [here](examples/listenAndRate/rhymeShortest.txt).

Apart from the spreadsheet and the soundfiles, you need to provide some files like the text for this 'hello'-screen, instructions, consent form etc. in markdown format. You can see the markdown file used to generate this page [here](examples/listenAndRate/hello.md)

If you want to proceed to the example trial, click below. It involves a single trial from [Wagner & McCurdy (2010)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20889149/). At the end of the experiment you will be displayed the data that was saved. The data will actually be saved but will be destroyed.

If instead you'd like to see a different study, here are a few other examples:


* A slightly longer study illustrating different ratings scales:  [here](https://prosodylab.org/experimenter/testExperiment/exampleScales.html)


* Listen and Record: [here](https://prosodylab.org/experimenter/testExperiment/exampleListenAndRecord.html)

* Planned production: [here](https://prosodylab.org/experimenter/testExperiment/examplePlannedProduction.html)

* A complete study with various elements, including consent form etc.:  [here](https://prosodylab.org/experimenter/testExperiment/exampleFullExperiment.html)
