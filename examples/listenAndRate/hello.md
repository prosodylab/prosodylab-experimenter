## Welcome!

This is a just test experiment, **and not a real study!**

It is meant to illustrate the prosodylab-js-experimenter. 

If you are here because you want to participate in an actual study, you're in the wrong place!

The following experiment is a study in which you have to one rhyme. 

You can see the spreadsheet (a tab-delimited text file) used to generate the experiment [here](examples/listenAndRate/rhymeShortest.txt).

Apart from the spreadsheet and the soundfiles, you need to provide some files like the text for this 'hello'-screen, instructions, consent form etc. in markdown format. You can see the markdown file used to generate this page [here](examples/listenAndRate/hello.md)

If you want to proceed to the example trial, click below. It involves a single trial from [Wagner & McCurdy (2010)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20889149/). At the end of the experiment you will be displayed the data that was saved. The data will not be saved.

If instead you'd like to see a different study, here are a few other examples:


* A longer version (10 trials), illustrating different multiple sessions and different kinds of ratings scales:  [here](https://prosodylab.org/experimenter/examples/exampleScales.html)

* The same slightly longer study, but this time not just the instructions and actual experiment trials with all the other trappings too (go to full screen, consent form, soundcheck, head phone screener, mic check, language questionnaire, post-experiment questionnaire, music questionnaire):  [here](https://prosodylab.org/experimenter/examples/exampleFullExperiment.html)
