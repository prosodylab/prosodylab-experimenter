## Welcome!


This is an illustration of an experiment where one listens to a soundfile, and then is recorded. You can see the spreadsheet used to generate this experiment [here](examples/listenAndRecord/arithListenRecord.txtt)

To try this out, you need to use Firefox or Chrome---it will not work in a different browser!



**If you proceed you will be recorded, but the recorded will be deleted. This is just for illustration purposes.**
