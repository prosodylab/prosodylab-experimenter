## Welcome!


This is an illustration of an experiment where one listens to a soundfile, and then is recorded. You can see the spreadsheet used to generate this experiment [here](examples/listenAndRecord/arithListenRecord.txtt)

To try this out, you need to use Firefox or Chrome---it will not work in a different browser!

We are currently conducting a related study, using recordings from a prior production experiment.

**Click here to proceed. The browser will record during the relevant part of the trial, but the recording will not be saved**
