### Test for Arithmetics Production Experiment


This is an experiment about arithmetics formulas, and how we convey them in speech. 

**This experiment will only work in Chrome or Firefox**

If you have one, use a headset-microphone. If you do use one, make sure your computer is set to use the headset for input and output. If you don't have one, just use your built-in mic and speakers.


On each trial, you will first listen to a formula. We have cut out the the final part with the result (originally, the sound file included 'equals x' at the end, where 'x' stands for the correct result). 


Your task is to calculate the result, and then you will be recorded saying the entire formula including the result.

When you are recorded, please say the entire formula, and add "equals X" at the end, where "X" stands for the result you calculated.

So for example, if you heard:

(3+5)

Your task is to calculate the result: 8. And then click on 'record' and say the following:

"three plus five equals eight"


You will have to say the entire from memory, but no worries, you can listen to the formula multiple times, until you're sure that you remember it.
