## Consent Form

Principal Investigator: Michael Wagner, McGill University, Linguistics Department
1085 Dr. Penfield Avenue, Montreal, QC H3A 1A7. chael@mcgill.ca

You are invited to participate in a research study looking at speech. Please read this form carefully and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to take part in the study.    

**Investigators:** Dr. Michael Wagner (Professor of Linguistics at  McGill University), and students and research assistants in Michael Wagnerâ€™s prosody.lab at McGill. Funding comes from NSERC grant RGPIN-2018-06153, SSHRC grant SSHRC 435-2020-0705, as well as funds from McGill University. If this experiment is part of a class (e.g., McGill Ling 450 Laboratory Linguistics), then participants of this class might also have access to the anonymized data.    

**What this study is about:** The purpose of this study is to investigate the precise way in which human beings are able to produce and perceive speech.    

**What we will ask you to do:**  In this study you will listen to and produce speech, and answer  questions about it. Your voice will be recorded. We will also collect some general information about your language and musical background to be able to better interpret the data.

**Duration of the study:** This study will take about 10 min.    

**Risks and benefits:** This experiment involves no known risks or discomfort to you beyond the risks of everyday life, nor is it expected to be of any direct benefit to you. However, you may find the project interesting and learn something about research on language and speech. Make sure your headphones  are set to a comfortable level and adjust the volume on your computer if you find the sounds too you too loud or too silent.

**Compensation:** You will be compensated according to the amount specified on the Prolific page.

**Use of your data:** The data collected in this study will be stored on a secure McGill server and on a cloud-storage service (either Google Drive or Dropbox). Your Prolific ID will not be directly linked to your data but will be stored separately (we only store the session ID with the data). We will delete the separately stored Prolific ID from our files within one year at the latest.

The data we collect may also be used to illustrate the results of the research results in an online interactive site. The anonymized data may also be published as part of an anonymous corpus distributed (an anonymous database of research data and speech files) for further research. By consenting to releasing your data as a corpus, you will help ensure that your contribution will have a more lasting impact.

Your Prolific ID will not be associated with the files in any way in any publication of sound files, research publication, or academic presentation, but you should be aware that in principle, someone who has access to other sound data by you that is identifiable (for example, if you post a youtube video of yourself speaking under your name) could use voice recognition to compare them to our anonymized data and potentially identify which recordings were produced by you. While this is at this point in time non-trivial and unlikely to succeed (since voice-recognition software is not very reliable, and identified sound data is not readily available), it could be that future technologically will make this easier.

**Taking part is voluntary:** Your participation is completely voluntary. You are free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the project at any time without penalty. However, data cannot be withdrawn after the information linking your Prolific ID to your data has been deleted. 

**If you have any questions:**  You can contact the principal investigator, Dr. Michael Wagner (email: chael@mcgill.ca) with questions. When communicating by email, please be aware that information provided in emails is not absolutely safe and may be intercepted. This experiment is being run under the McGill Research Ethics Board protocols #401-0409/#342-0118. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this study, you may contact the Research Ethics Board Office at 514-398-6831 or access their website at:
