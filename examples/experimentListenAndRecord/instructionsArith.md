### Test for Arithmetics Production Experiment


This is an experiment about arithmetics formulas, and how we convey them in speech. 

**This will only work in Chrome or Firefox**

If you have one, use a headset-microphone. If you do use one, make sure your computer is set to use the headset for input and output. If you don't have one, just use your built-in mic and speakers.


You will have to listen to the formula, and calculate the result. You can listen to the formula multiple times.

Then, when you're ready, you'll be recorded on reading the formula, including the result.

When you are recorded, please say the entire formula, and add "equals X" at the end, where "X" stands for the result you calculated.


So for example, if you heard:

(3+5)

Your task is to calculate the result: 8. And then click on 'record' and say the following:

"three plus five equals eight"
