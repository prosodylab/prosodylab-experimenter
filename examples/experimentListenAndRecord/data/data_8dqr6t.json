If you do use one, make sure your computer is set to use the headset for input and output. If you don't have one, just use your built-in mic and speakers.</p>\n<p>You will have to listen to the formula, and calculate the result. You can listen to the formula multiple times.</p>\n<p>Then, when you're ready, you'll be recorded on reading the formula, including the result.</p>\n<p>When you are recorded, please say the entire formula, and add \"equals X\" at the end, where \"X\" stands for the result you calculated.</p>\n<p>So for example, if you heard:</p>\n<p>(3+5)</p>\n<p>Your task is to calculate the result: 8. And then click on 'record' and say the following:</p>\n<p>\"three plus five equals eight\"</p>\n</div><br><br>","button_pressed":"0","component":"Instructions","buttonResponseText":["Press any key to
