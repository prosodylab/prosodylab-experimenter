This is an illustration of a planned production experiment. You can see the spreadsheet used to generate this experiment [here](examples/plannedProduction/plannedProductionExample.txt)

To try this out, you need to use Firefox or Chrome---it will not work in a different browser!

The rhymes you see are from the perception study on rhyming reported in [Wagner & McCurdy (2010)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20889149/). We conducted a production study on these stimuli in 2015, and are currently writing up the results, and are in the progress of replicating the results using this online tool.
