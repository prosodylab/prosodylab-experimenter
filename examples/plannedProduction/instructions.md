### Instructions


In this experiment you will be recorded on saying on sequences of sentences.


On every trial, you will be shown a sequence of 2 sentences.

You will first have to time to read them, and then, when you're ready, you can start the recording.

Your task is to say them out aloud as naturally as possible, as if in a conversation with a friend. 

Once the recording is done, you are asked to rate how natural the sequences of sentences sounded to you.

It is important that you first carefully read what you have to say, and only the click to start the recording.
