You are invited to participate in a research study looking at the production and/or perception of speech. Please read this form carefully and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to take part in the study.    

**Investigators:** Dr. Michael Wagner (Professor of Linguistics at  McGill University), and graduate students and research assistants in Michael Wagner’s prosody.lab at McGill. If this experiment is part of a class (e.g., McGill Ling 450 Laboratory Linguistics), then participants of this class might also have access to the anonymized data.    

**What this study is about:** The purpose of this study is to investigate the precise way in which human beings are able to produce and perceive speech.    

**What we will ask you to do:** If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to (i) produce speech, and this recording will subsequently be acoustically analyzed and/or (ii) listen to speech or other sound stimuli or read sentences and answer questions about them.     

Risks and benefits: This experiment involves no known risks or discomfort to you beyond the risks of everyday life, nor is it expected to be of any direct benefit to you. However, you may find the project interesting and learn something about research on language and speech. You can ask after the experiment what we’re trying to find out with our research. If there is any reason for discomfort during the experiment (for example, if you find the sounds played to you too loud or too silent) please let the experimenter know.    

**Compensation:** You will compensation according to the amount specified in the MTurk hit.    

**Use of your data:** The data (responses and sound data) collected in this study will be stored on a pass-word protected computer as well as backed up on a secure McGill server and on a cloud-storage service (either Google Drive or Dropbox). Your name will only appear on the consent form (which are stored in a locked filing cabinet) and our electronic participant record (stored with password protection on a  computer as well as on a secure McGill server), and will not be directly linked to the data.    

The information linking the data with your name will only be accessible to the investigators in our lab (the PI and research assistants). Any publications and presentations coming out of this research will only report anonymously on the data we collect. 

The data may also be used to illustrate the results of the research results in an online interactive site. The anonymized data may also be published as part of an anonymous corpus distributed (an anonymous database of research data and speech files) for further research. By consenting to releasing your data as a corpus, you will help ensure that your contribution will have a more lasting impact on linguistic research. 

Your name and personal information will never be associated with the files in any way in any publication of sound files, research publication, or academic presentation, but you should be aware that in principle, someone who has access to other sound data by you that is identifiable (for example, if you post a youtube video of yourself speaking under your name) could use voice recognition to compare them to our anonymized data and potentially identify which recordings were produced by you. While this is at this point in time non-trivial and unlikely to succeed (since voice-recognition software is not very reliable and identified sound data is not readily available, compared to, say photos with identifying information), it could be that future technologically will make this easier. 

**Taking part is voluntary:** Your participation is completely voluntary. You are free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the project at any time without penalty. If you withdraw, all data you provided will be destroyed unless you indicate otherwise. Data cannot be withdrawn after the information linking your name to your data has been destroyed. This will be done 3 years after the study has been completed. Please also note that once recordings are put in the public corpus, they cannot be withdrawn.

**If you have any questions:**  Please also feel free to contact one of the investigators, Dr. Michael Wagner (email: chael@mcgill.ca) with questions. When communicating by email, please be aware that information provided in emails is not absolutely safe and may be intercepted. This experiment is being run under the McGill Research Ethics Board protocols #401-0409/#342-0118. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this study, you may contact the Research Ethics Board Office at 514-398-6831 or access their website at:

**STATEMENT OF CONSENT:**

I consent to take part in the study. I consent to be audio recorded. I agree that the audio recordings could be used in related follow-up studies (for example, that they might be played to future participants in a perception experiment). I agree to the anonymous use of recordings in research presentations, publications, and online interactive sites to illustrate the findings. I agree to the use of recordings in a not-for-profit anonymous corpus for research purposes which others will have access to.
