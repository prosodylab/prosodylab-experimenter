## Welcome!

This is a test experiment, illustrating the [prosodylabExperimenter](https://prosodylab.github.io/prosodylabExperimenter/).

**This is not a real study!** If you are here because you want to participate in an actual study, you're in the wrong place!

This is a study about rhymes.

You can see the spreadsheet (a tab-delimited text file) used to generate the experiment [here](experiment/rhymeShortest.txt).

Apart from the spreadsheet and the soundfiles, you need to provide some files like the text for this 'hello'-screen, instructions, consent form, and potentially a 'goodbye' screen in markdown format. You can see the markdown file used to generate this page [here](experiment/hello.md)

If you want to proceed to the example, click below. The experiment involves some trials from [Wagner & McCurdy (2010)](https://www.semanticsarchive.net/Archive/zVjOWI5M/index.html). At the end of the experiment you will be displayed the data that was saved. The data will not be saved.

Click here if you want to skip the consent form and language questionnaire, and just do a few rhyme rating trials: [prosodylab.org/experimenter/template?session=1](prosodylab.org/experimenter/template?session=1)
