### Rhyme  practice


You will be to listening to sequences of repetitions of words, and then answer some questions about them. 

For example, you might her a stream of words that might sound either like repetitions of 'baga' or 'gaba'.

Your task is first to answer which words you heard (e.g., baga vs. gaba).

You are then asked which syllable in the word was **stressed**. 

Word stress will be marked  by **CAPital** **LEtters** on the stressed syllable.

For example, in the word 'CARgo', the first syllable is stressed: (CARgo not carGO).

But in the word 'atTEMPT', the second syllable is stressed (attEMPT, not ATTempt).
